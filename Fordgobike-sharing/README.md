# Bike Sharing in San Franscisco Bay Area Exploration
## by Janat Birungi


## Dataset

I chose the Ford GoBike System Data for my exploration. This consisted of rides taken in the greater San Frascisco bay area. The dataset contains 183,412 records and 16 variables(duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip).
There are bike, location, time and user characteristic variables available. The user characteristics like member gender, user_type are categorical.


## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found out there is a strong relationship between start hour of the ride and day of week with a consistent pattern across the different sexes. Most trips were taken on Thursday and Tuesday, and males were more likely to take a ride and their rides were much shorter than the female and other sexes. 

Comparing the relationship between day of week, gender and duration, the longest trips are taken by the other sex and this usually happens on the weekends. Females are the second at taking long trips and men take the shortest trips. All the different sexes take the longest trips on Sunday.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the influence of day of week, duration of ride, and gender on start hour of the ride. I start by introducing the start hour, the main variable, using a histogram. Then a distirbution of day of week using a bar chart. 

NextI look at the relationship among the different variables like gender, day of week and start hour using a heatmap. Then I look at the relationship among gender, day of week and duration of ride plotted on a heatmap. I use color to differentiate the two heatmpas and make it clear that these are different plots.
